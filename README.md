# High Noon
The best shooter game ever made ever

### Project Plan ###
goal one:
- on a street - shoot the guy
- on a street - two player
- training zone where you shoot bottles thrown in the air
- adapt to VR

Both need some modelling work
- breakable bottle
- animated oponent
- animated gun
- some particle effects for shooting the gun

Networking needed too

Goal two:
- better two player
- a couple of missions where you shoot bandits
- maybe use cover

More modelling
- characters
- weapon skins
- different hats (and other things)
- different weapons - not for pvp duals - probably

Goal three - probably won't get here
- full story - 5-10 missions maybe an hour to finish (could be more) - think time crisis
- 2 player story co-op - think time crisis
- another multiplayer pvp mode - maybe hide behind cover
