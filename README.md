# High Noon
The best shooter game ever made ever

### Project Plan ###
goal one:
- on a street - shoot the guy
- on a street - two player
- training zone where you shoot bottles thrown in the air
- adapt to VR

Both need some modelling work
- breakable bottle
- animated oponent
- animated gun
- some particle effects for shooting the gun

Networking needed too

Goal two:
- better two player
- a couple of missions where you shoot bandits
- maybe use cover

More modelling
- characters
- weapon skins
- different hats (and other things)
