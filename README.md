# High Noon
The best shooter game ever made ever

### Project Plan ###
goal one - target completion date: 13th-20th of march
- on a street - shoot the guy
- on a street - two player
- training zone where you shoot bottles thrown in the air
- adapt to VR

Both need some modelling work - Seb can do this
- breakable bottle
- animated oponent
- animated gun
- some particle effects for shooting the gun

Networking needed too - spyro can do this, yeah?
- I saw something called photon unity networking - could be an easy solution (https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/1786)

Goal two:
- better two player
- a couple of missions where you shoot bandits
- maybe use cover

More modelling
- characters
- weapon skins
- different hats (and other things)
- different weapons - not for pvp duals - probably

before starting goal three decide on how to progress - we will have spent a couple of weeks working on this by now and a descision needs to be made as to wheter this project should be continued, is it could enough to release, is it good enough to sell, platforms, occulus touch, psvr, vive, all of these things cost money.

Goal three - probably won't get here
- full story - 5-10 missions maybe an hour to finish (could be more) - think time crisis
- 2 player story co-op - think time crisis
- another multiplayer pvp mode - maybe hide behind cover
